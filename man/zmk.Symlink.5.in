.Sh NAME
.Nm Symlink
.Nd template for creating symbolic links
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
include z.mk
# "link" is any valid identifier.
link.SymlinkTarget = target
$(eval $(call ZMK.Expand,Symlink,link))
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The template
.Nm Symlink
once
.Em expanded
with a
.Em link name
to creates rules for creating, removing, installing and removing a single
symbolic link to a given target file.
.Pp
This template behaves like the Program template, in that it creates the
symbolic link both locally, during development as well as when the project
is installed.
.Sh TARGETS
This module provides the following targets.
.Ss $(link)
This target represents the symbolic link
.Ss all
This
.Em phony
target depends on
.Em $(link)
.Ss clean
This
.Em phony
target removes
.Em $(link)
.Ss install
This target creates the symbolic link
.Em $(link)
in
.Em $(link.InstallDir) ,
with the name
.Em $(link.InstallName)
The target directory is automatically created if required.
.Ss uninstall
This
.Em phony
target removes
.Em $(link)
as installed by the
.Em install
target.
.Sh VARIABLES
This module provides the following variables.
.Ss $(link).SymlinkTarget
The target of the symbolic link.
.Pp
There is no default value. This variable must be set before
.Em expanding
the template.
.Ss $(programName).InstallDir
The directory
.Em $(link)
is installed to.
.Pp
There is no default value. This variable must be set before
.Em expanding
the template. To avoid installation set the install directory
to the special value
.Em noinst .
.Ss $(link).InstallName
The name of the program after installation.
.Pp
The default value is
.Em $(link)
with the directory part removed.
.Ss DESTDIR
Path added to all installation targets.
.Pp
This variable is normally set externally, to install a compiled program
into a staging area during construction of a compiled binary package.
.Sh BUGS
Prior to version 0.5.1, the
.Em install
target misbehaved when
.Em $(link)
contains a non-empty directory prefix. Incorrectly, the same prefix is
replicated, somewhat confusingly in the installed symlink.
.Pp
Consider this example:
.Bd -literal 4
include z.mk
subdir/link.SymlinkTarget = target
subdir/link.InstallDir = $(bindir)
$(eval $(call ZMK.Expand,Symlink,subdir/link))
.Ed
Running
.Em make install
on the following example would create the symbolic link
.Em $(bindir)/subdir/link -> target,
which was unexpected.
.Pp
This bug was given the identifier
.Em zmk-issue-80 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
template first appeared in zmk 0.1
