.Dt zmk.Tarball.Src 5 PRM
.Sh NAME
.Nm Tarball.Src
.Nd module for creating release archives
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
include z.mk

archiveName = $(NAME)-$(VERSION).tar.gz
$(archiveName).Files = hello.c
$(eval $(call ZMK.Expand,Tarball.Src,$(archiveName)))
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Sh TARGETS
This module provides the following targets
.Ss $(archiveName)
This target describes the archive itself. The contents of this archive depends on
several factors, see
.Nm $(archiveName).Files .
.Ss $(archiveName).asc
.Ss dist
.Ss distcheck
.Sh VARIABLES
.Ss $(ZMK_DO_NOT_BUNDLE)
If the
.Ev $(ZMK_DO_NOT_BUNDLE)
variable is set to
.Em yes
then zmk will not automatically include itself into each source achive.
.Pp
By default a copy of zmk is bundled with each archive so that receipents of the
software do not need to install zmk to compile programs that use it for their
build system, similarly to how autotools works, but perhaps with less unreadable
code in the process.
.Ss $(archiveName).Name
The
.Nm $(archiveName).Name
variable is, by default, set to the name of the archive without the
.Em .tar.*
extension.
.Pp
The value controls the name of the directory holding all the files inside the archive.
.Ss $(archiveName).Files
The
.Nm $(archiveName).Files
variable contains the list of files to place in the archive.
.Pp
Several files may be bundled automatically
.Bl -bullet
.It
The
.Em configure
script is automatically included when the
.Xr zmk.Configure 5
module is imported. This way the generated archive contains a script
which can be used for interactive configuration of the build system.
.It
The
.Em zmk
directory along with the entire source code of the locally
used distribution of the build system.
You can set the environment variable
.Ev ZMK_DO_NOT_BUNDLE
to
.Em yes
to prevent this from happening.
.It
The
.Em .version-from-git
file if tye
.Xr zmk.GitVersion 5
module is imported and
.Em git
history is present and it can be used to generate a version identifier.
Note that the file is automatically renamed to just
.Em .version
when it is placed inside the archive.
.It
The
.Em .version
file if it was already present in the tree. This
.El
.Ss $(archiveName).Sign
The
.Nm $(archiveName).Sign
variable is set to a non-empty value if the archive is to be GPG signed.
.Pp
GPG signatures are not created if GPG is not installed, if the user has no GPG keys
if the tarball is a git snapshot or if the
.Nm CI
environment variable is set.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The
.Ev ZMK_DO_NOT_BUNDLE
environment variable can be set to
.Em yes
to disable zmk from automatically bundling itself into each source archive.
