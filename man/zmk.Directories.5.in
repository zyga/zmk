.Sh NAME
.Nm Directories
.Nd module providing names and rules for common directories
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
include z.mk

$(eval $(call ZMK.Import,Directories))
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The module
.Nm
provides names and rules for commonly used directories. Is is used indirectly
by other targets, to know where to install files of various types, but can be
also imported and used directly for custom rules.
.Pp
All directories are derived from the value of
.Nm prefix .
The default value is
.Em /usr/local ,
which is suitable for locally-built and installed software packages.
Linux distribution packages are compiled with prefix of
.Em /usr ,
along with dedicated values of
.Nm sysconfdir
and other variables. This customization is usually handled by invoking the
.Em configure
script with specific command-line options.
.Sh TARGETS
This module provides targets that create all the directories mentioned below,
also taking into account the
.Nm $(DESTDIR)
variable.
.Sh VARIABLES
This module provides the following variables.
.Ss DESTDIR
Temporary staging location used while building software packages. It is
prepended to all installation targets, to allow them to be redirected to
another directory, usually without root privileges.
.Ss prefix
Prefix of all the other directories.
.Pp
The default value is
.Em /usr/local .
.Ss exec_prefix
Prefix of directories where executables are installed.
.Pp
The default value is
.Em $(prefix) .
.Ss bindir
Directory with programs available to all users.
.Pp
The default value is
.Em $(exec_prefix)/bin .
.Ss sbindir
Directory with programs available to system administrators.
.Pp
The default value is
.Em $(exec_prefix)/sbin .
.Ss libexecdir
Directory with programs used not directly invoked by the user.
.Pp
The default value is
.Em $(exec_prefix)/libexec .
.Pp
This directory differs between two major distribution lines, RedHat and Debian
and their respective derivatives. The former uses
.Em /usr/libexec
while the latter uses
.Em /usr/lib .
.Ss datarootdir
Directory several classes of data files.
.Pp
The default value is
.Em $(prefix)/share .
.Ss datadir
Directory with architecture independent data files.
.Pp
The default value is
.Em $(datarootdir) .
.Ss sysconfdir
Directory with system configuration files.
.Pp
The default value is
.Em $(prefix)/etc .
.Pp
In distribution packaging this directory is typically overriden to be detached
from prefix and hold the literal value
.Em /etc .
.Ss sharedstatedir
Directory with system state shared among machines on the network.
Virtually extinct, do not use it.
.Pp
The default value is
.Em $(prefix)/com .
.Ss localstatedir
Directory with persistent system state, private to the current machine.
.Pp
The default value is
.Em $(prefix)/var .
.Ss runstatedir
Directory with ephemeral system state, private to the current machine.
.Pp
The default value is
.Em $(prefix)/run .
.Ss includedir
Directory with C, C++ and Objective C header files.
.Pp
The default value is
.Em $(prefix)/include .
.Ss docdir
Directory with documentation specific to the project.
.Pp
The default value is
.Em $(prefix)/doc/$(NAME) .
Since the value depends on NAME, it is only defined
when NAME is also defined.
.Ss infodir
Directory with documentation in the Info format.
.Pp
The default value is
.Em $(prefix)/doc/info .
.Ss libdir
Directory with stattic or dynamic libraries.
.Pp
The default value is
.Em $(exec_prefix)/lib .
.Pp
This directory differs between Linux distributions. Some distribututions
differentiate between 32bit and 64bit libraries while others store libraries in
a directory named after the architecture triplet they are compiled for. It is
common for one system to use a mixture of directories used at the same time,
mainly to adhere to file system hierarchy standards.
.Ss localedir
Directory with localization catalogs, including message translation tables.
.Pp
The default value is
.Em $(datarootdir)/locale .
.Ss mandir
Directory root for manual pages. Actual manual pages are stored
in sub-directories named after the manual section number.
.Pp
The default value is
.Em $(datarootdir)/man .
.Ss man1dir .. man9dir
Directory with manual pages of a specific section.
.Pp
The default value is
.Em $(mandir)/man1
\&..
.Em $(mandir)/man9 .
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example illustrates a way to install the program
.Em foo
to the directory with programs available to all the users. The
.Em order-only
prerequisite ensures that the target directory is created.
