.Sh NAME
.Nm Silent
.Nd module for supporting silent rules
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
include z.mk
$(eval $(call ZMK.Import,Silent))
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm Silent
module, once
.Em imported ,
provides functions and variables for supporting
.Em silent rules .
Silent rules are a configuration option, trading precision of the exact
commands used by the build system, for better visibility of warnings and other
output. When enabled, actual commands executed by Make are hidden and a
symbolic representation replaced with a symbolic representation devoid of
details.
.Pp
Silent rules are usually a configuration option of a specific build workspace.
To enable, execute the
.Em configure
script with the option
.Em --enable-silent-rules .
.Sh TARGETS
This module does not provide any targets.
.Sh VARIABLES
This module provides the following variables.
.Ss Silent.Active
The global silent mode toggle. Any non-empty value enables silent rules.
This is automatically configured by the
.Nm Configure
module.
.Ss Silent.Command
Expands to
.Em @
when silent rules are active. Can be placed in front of commands of a make rule
to cause make not to echo the command itself. It should be paired with
.Nm Silent.Say
for the complete experience.
.Ss Silent.Say
Function expanding to a shell command printing the 1st and 2nd argument.
The first argument should be the symbolic name of the tool, such as CC
or LD. The second argument should be the resulting file, i.e. $@.
.Sh EXAMPLES
A hypothetical rule for compiling .foo files to .fooobj files, supporting silent
rules, might look like this.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
include z.mk
$(eval $(call ZMK.Import,Silent))

%.fooobj: %.foo
    $(eval $(call Silent.Say,FOOCC,$@))
    $(Silent.Command)foocc -c $^ -o $@
