.Sh NAME
.Nm Configure
.Nd module providing build time configuration system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
include z.mk

$(eval $(call ZMK.Import,Configure))
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
module provides two sides of the build-time configuration system. On one hand
side it provides the familiar
.Em configure
script, which can be used to set up various settings, prepare a directory for
.Em out-of-tree build ,
and integrate with project specific configuration settings. On the other hand
it exposes the collected information as a set of variables, allowing the rest
of the build system to modify its behavior accordingly.
.Sh TARGETS
This module provides the following targets.
.Ss configure
This target generates the configuration script. The script is also
automatically placed inside the source archive, so that the receipent
does not need to have a local installation of
.Em zmk
to build a project from source.
.Ss GNUmakefile.configure.mk
This target is named after the configuration file created by the
.Nm configure
script. The rules are such, that if the configure script is newer than the
configuration file, then the script is re-executed to generate a possibly
updated configuration file.
.Ss distclean
This
.Em phony
target removes the configuration file
.Nm GNUmakefile.configure.mk .
In
.Em maintainer mode ,
the cofiguration file is also removed.
.Sh VARIABLES
This module provides the following variables.
.Ss Configure.HostArchTriplet
This variable is set by the
.Nm configure
script when invoked with the
.Em --host=...
option. It represents the
.Em triplet
describing the system which will eventually execute
the compiled binaries. This is in contrast to the system that
is preforming the build.
.Pp
Unlike in
.Em autoconf
this variable is not set automatically. It is usually provided by
.Em Linux distribution packaging
which follows the up-to-date conventions on architecture triplet names.
The triplet contains three components, separated by dashes, the
.Em CPU architecture ,
.Em Kernel name
and
.Em Operating System name .
Popular values include
.Em x86_64-linux-gnu ,
.Em aarch64-linux-gnu
and
.Em riscv64-linux-gnu .
Note that there is a lot of variablity in the architecte name and special
cases related to the ARM architecture.
.Ss Configure.BuildArchTriplet
This variable is set by the
.Nm configure
script when invoked with the
.Em --build=...
option. It represents the
.Em triplet
describing the system which is performing the build process. This is in
contrast to the system that will execute the built binaries.
.Pp
When both
.Nm Configure.HostArchTriplet
and
.Nm Configure.BuildArchTriplet
are set and their values differ and
when
.Nm CC
and
.Nm CXX
are not overriden, then zmk automatically selects a
.Em cross-compiler
from the
.Em GNU Compiler Collection
named
.Em $(Configure.HostArchTriplet)-gcc
and
.Em $(Configure.HostArchTriplet)-g++
for the C and C++ compilers, respectively.
.Ss Configure.DependencyTracking
This variable is controlled by the
.Nm configure
script options
.Em --enable-dependency-tracking
(defaut) and
.Em --disable-dependency-tracking .
When enabled it expands to
.Em yes
and causes compatible compilers to generate dependency information when
compiling source files, that is subsequently used by Make to understand
relationship between all the source files and object files.
.Pp
When performing pristine builds in a scratch environment that does not
contain any old object files, this setting can be disabled to speed up the
build a little.
.Ss Configure.MaintainerMode
This variable is controlled by the
.Nm configure
script options
.Em --enable-maintainer-mode
(defaut) and
.Em --disable-maintainer-mode .
When enabled it expands to
.Em yes
and impacts the
.Nm configure
and
.Nm GNUmakefile.configure.mk
targets as described earlier.
.Ss Configure.SilentRules
This variable is controlled by the
.Nm configure
script options
.Em --enable-silent-rules
and
.Em --disable-silent-rules
(default). When enabled it expands to
.Em yes
and silences make rules defined by zmk.
.Ss Configure.ProgramPrefix
This variable is set by the
.Nm configure
script when invoked with the
.Em --program-prefix=...
option.
.Pp
The argument is the prefix added to installed name of all the programs built
with the
.Nm Program
and the
.Nm Script
templates.
.Ss Configure.ProgramSuffix
This variable is set by the
.Nm configure
script when invoked with the
.Em --program-suffix=...
option.
.Pp
The argument is the suffix added to installed name of all the programs built
with the
.Nm Program
and the
.Nm Script
templates.
.Ss Configure.ProgramTransformName
This variable is set by the
.Nm configure
script when invoked with the
.Em --program-transform-name=...
option.
.Pp
The argument is a sed expression used to transform the installed name of all
the programs built with the
.Nm Program
and the
.Nm Script
templates. The transformation affects the entire name, together with any
prefix or suffix defined byo ther options.
.Ss Configure.Configured
This variable expands to
.Em yes
when the
.Nm configure
script was used to customize the build process. It can be used to offer
default behaviors that are appropriate to a given project, without
interacting with customizations performed by distribution packaging.
.Ss Configure.Options
This variable expands to the command line arguments passed to the
.Nm configure
script. It is used for automatic re-configuration supported by
.Em maintainer mode .
It can be also provided to the
.Em pre-processor
to embed the information about build-time configuration into the application
or library binary.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The
.Nm Configure
module is automatically imported and is implicitly available when templates
such as
.Nm Program
or
.Nm Script
are used. It does not require any additional input files. All customization
is available directly from the project makefile.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
module first appeared in zmk 0.3
