.Sh NAME
.Nm Coverity
.Nd Module for interacting with Coverity static analysis tool
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bd -literal
include z.mk
# additional definitions required
$(eval $(call ZMK.Import,Coverity))
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The module
.Nm Coverity
allows preparing and uploading scan artifacts to a hosted coverity instance.
.Sh TARGETS
This module provides the following targets.
.Ss upload-coverity-scan
This
.Em phony
target uses
.Nm curl
to upload the archived scan artifacts to the coverity scanning service.
.Ss clean
This
.Em phony
target removes the
.Nm cov-int
directory as well as the
.Nm cov-int.$(NAME)-$(VERSION).tar.gz
archive.
.Ss cov-int
This target invokes the
.Nm cov-build
program to forcibly re-build the whole project and collect information for analysis.
.Ss cov-int.$(NAME)-$(VERSION).tar.gz
This target archives the
.Nm cov-int
directory.
.Sh VARIABLES
This module provides the following variables.
.Ss Coverity.Sources
List of source files to consider as analysis dependency.
.Pp
There is no default value. This variable must be set before importing the
module.
.Ss Coverity.ProjectName
Name of the project registered on the Coverity instance
.Pp
There is no default value. This variable must be set before importing the
module.
.Ss Coverity.Email
E-mail address of the project maintainer, as registered on the Coverity
instance.
.Pp
There is no default value. This variable must be set before importing the
module.
.Ss Coverity.Token
The token used to authorize uploads of scan artifacts.

There is no default value. This variable must be set before importing the
module.
.Ss Coverity.ScanURL
The URL used for submitting scan artifacts.
.Pp

.Em https://scan.coverity.com/builds
.Sh BUGS
This module uses recursive make invocation and is therefore not safe to execute
concurrently with other scanners that use this strategy.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example shows how Coverity can be used to scan a sample project.
The code assumes that local installation of coverity scanner is in
.Em /opt/cov-analysis-linux64-2019.03 .
The project name, maintainer email are provided in-line but the authentication
token is expected to be provided through the environment variable
.Nm COVERITY_TOKEN .
.Bd -literal
include z.mk
COVERITY_TOKEN ?=
ifneq (,$(COVERITY_TOKEN))  # enable coverity if secret token is available
Coverity.Sources=foo.c
Coverity.ProjectName=foo
Coverity.Email=maintainer@example.com
Coverity.Token=$(COVERITY_TOKEN)
cov-int: PATH := $(PATH):/opt/cov-analysis-linux64-2019.03/bin
$(eval $(call ZMK.Import,Coverity))
endif
