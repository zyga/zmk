Changes in 0.3 (unreleased):

 * For future extensibility backwards compatibility is dropped. All symbols are
   different. By the time this release is finalized a compatibility module may
   be introduced, if practical.

   - All variables now use CamelCase, not under_score. This includes template
	 instance variables, so for example "hello.sources" becomes
	 "hello.Sources".
   - All public variables are capitalized. This includes variables scoped with
	 the "ZMK.PublicName". Private variables are named like "ZMK.privateName"
	 and cannot be relied for backward compatibility across releases. All
	 public variables should be documented in the manual page corresponding to
	 the module or template name.
   - All custom variables are prefixed with module name, or "ZMK.".
   - Modules are imported with the ZMK.Import function, replacing "import".
	 Modules no longer have the "Module." prefix as it was somewhat redundant.
   - Templates are expanded with the ZMK.Expand function, replacing "spawn".
	 Templates no longer have the "Template." prefix as it was equally
	 redundant.
   - All module names are now using CamelCase naming. Some modules were
	 renamed, for example "git-version" became "GitVersion" and "PVS-Studio"
	 became just "PVS"

 * Introduction of manual pages for zmk. This is a longer effort but eventually
   all modules, templates, variables and rules will be documented.

 * Examples are now part of the distribution archive.

 * The true_false example illustrates how preprocessor options can
   vary per target, even if the same source file is used in more than one
   program.

 * Examples are now much more terse and to the point.

 * The Directories module now warns if DESTDIR is defined inside a makefile.

 * The Toolchain module no longer removes all object files.

 * The Toolchain module now prefixes all non-standard variables with
   Toolchain, to avoid confusion and clashes with user code.

 * The Tarball.Src module no longer signs the release archive
   from a git-versioned snapshot.

 * The Tarball module, when used on Darwin, no longer now forgets to
   add the versioned top-level directory, matching the experience on Linux.

 * The GitVersion module now detects some CI systems and alerts the
   user of a possibility of a shallow git clone.

 * Test suite is now part of the distribution archive. All examples are tested,
   some modules are also separately tested, to ensure coverage.

 * C++ is now supported for all programs and library types.

 * Objective C is now supported for all programs and library types. Certain
   special features related to gnu-step were dropped. Those are better applied
   in actual project makefiles where they can be precise and accurate.

 * Numerous smaller bug were found and fixed.

Changes in 0.2:

 * The Template.data module now handles nested directories better.

 * The Module.configure module can now synthesize the configure script.

 * The configure script now handles --runtstatedir=DIR option.

 * The configure script no longer considers --build=TRIPLET as cross-compiling,
   both --build=TRIPLET and --host=TRIPLET must be used and must differ for
   that to happen.

 * The configure script now supports --help and --version options.

 * The Module.git-version module now strips leading "v" from tags.

 * The Module.git-version module no longer clashes with Debian packaging
   and now collaborates with Template.tarball.src module to store the version
   in a .version file.

 * The new Template.tarball.src module now creates GPG signatures for
   release tarball and handles the .version file.

 * ZMK now generates all required files and stores them into source archives
   created with Template.tarball.src. Generated data can be removed with the
   distclean target.

Changes in 0.1:

 * Initial release with the build system extracted out of libzt.
