Changes in the next release:

* The ObjectGroup template used by Program, Program.Test, Library.A, Library.So
  and Library.DyLib is now performing rudimentary detection of a missing compiler.

* The GitVersion module now provides GitVersion.Origin attribute
  to indicate how the version information was obtained. The value "git" is used
  when git history along with git tags were used. The value "file" is used when
  the .version file was read.

* The Tarball.Src template no longer breaks when used from a dist archive.

Changes in 0.3.8:

* The release archive now contains the full collection of test files.

Changes in 0.3.7:

* The release archive no longer contains the pre-compiled manual pages. Instead
  the .in files are shipped, to be compiled locally.

Changes in 0.3.6:

* InstallUninstall no longer reuses the relative directory in the source tree
  to represent the target directory. Instead the InstallDir property is the
  only way to influence the final path. This was a late discovery but one that
  is ultimately only sensible. ZMK itself was adjusted to install correctly in
  this new scheme.

Changes in 0.3.5:

* Make distclean no longer breaks building of packages in Debian, by not
  removing the bundled zmk and the configure script that current packaging
  helpers cannot yet re-generate from zmk itself.

Changes in 0.3.4:

 * GitVersion no longer interferes with downstream packaging of releases
   by bundling the .version file for snapshots and tagged releases alike.

Changes in 0.3.3:

 * Tests no longer hang on case-insensitive filesystems.

 * The Directory module no longer issues warnings on MacOS

Changes in 0.3.2:

 * The ManPage module no longer installs files to the /man directory.

Changes in 0.3.1:

 * The GitVersion module now follows public/private variable naming scheme.
   The only public attribute is GitVersion.Active, which expands to yes if
   the module has altered VERSION as compared to what was set in the makefile.

 * The Tarball.Src module no longer attempts to sign releases in CI systems.
   and no longer issues warnings if the GitVersion module is not used.

Changes in 0.3:

 * For future extensibility backwards compatibility is dropped. All symbols are
   different. By the time this release is finalized a compatibility module may
   be introduced, if practical.

   - All variables now use CamelCase, not under_score. This includes template
	 instance variables, so for example "hello.sources" becomes
	 "hello.Sources".
   - All public variables are capitalized. This includes variables scoped with
	 the "ZMK.PublicName". Private variables are named like "ZMK.privateName"
	 and cannot be relied for backward compatibility across releases. All
	 public variables should be documented in the manual page corresponding to
	 the module or template name.
   - All custom variables are prefixed with module name, or "ZMK.".
   - Modules are imported with the ZMK.Import function, replacing "import".
	 Modules no longer have the "Module." prefix as it was somewhat redundant.
   - Templates are expanded with the ZMK.Expand function, replacing "spawn".
	 Templates no longer have the "Template." prefix as it was equally
	 redundant.
   - All module names are now using CamelCase naming. Some modules were
	 renamed, for example "git-version" became "GitVersion" and "PVS-Studio"
	 became just "PVS"

 * Introduction of manual pages for zmk. This is a longer effort but eventually
   all modules, templates, variables and rules will be documented.

 * Examples are now part of the distribution archive.

 * The true_false example illustrates how preprocessor options can
   vary per target, even if the same source file is used in more than one
   program.

 * Examples are now much more terse and to the point.

 * The Directories module now warns if DESTDIR is defined inside a makefile.

 * The Toolchain module no longer removes all object files.

 * The Toolchain module now prefixes all non-standard variables with
   Toolchain, to avoid confusion and clashes with user code.

 * The Tarball.Src module no longer signs the release archive
   from a git-versioned snapshot.

 * The Tarball module, when used on Darwin, no longer now forgets to
   add the versioned top-level directory, matching the experience on Linux.

 * The GitVersion module now detects some CI systems and alerts the
   user of a possibility of a shallow git clone.

 * Test suite is now part of the distribution archive. All examples are tested,
   some modules are also separately tested, to ensure coverage.

 * C++ is now supported for all programs and library types.

 * Objective C is now supported for all programs and library types. Certain
   special features related to gnu-step were dropped. Those are better applied
   in actual project makefiles where they can be precise and accurate.

 * Numerous smaller bug were found and fixed.

Changes in 0.2:

 * The Template.data module now handles nested directories better.

 * The Module.configure module can now synthesize the configure script.

 * The configure script now handles --runtstatedir=DIR option.

 * The configure script no longer considers --build=TRIPLET as cross-compiling,
   both --build=TRIPLET and --host=TRIPLET must be used and must differ for
   that to happen.

 * The configure script now supports --help and --version options.

 * The Module.git-version module now strips leading "v" from tags.

 * The Module.git-version module no longer clashes with Debian packaging
   and now collaborates with Template.tarball.src module to store the version
   in a .version file.

 * The new Template.tarball.src module now creates GPG signatures for
   release tarball and handles the .version file.

 * ZMK now generates all required files and stores them into source archives
   created with Template.tarball.src. Generated data can be removed with the
   distclean target.

Changes in 0.1:

 * Initial release with the build system extracted out of libzt.
